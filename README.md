# MyReads Project

This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this template is to save you time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```

## Handling The Application

The file contains two interfaces

1. The first interface is to display the shelves of books that are read, have been read, or that will be read, as it is possible to switch between the status of the book on the shelves or remove it by choosing None
2. The second interface is the search interface, through which one can search for new books and add them to the shelves of private books


## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
